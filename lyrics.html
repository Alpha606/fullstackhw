        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <pre>
            We were speeding together
            Down the dark avenues
            But besides all the stardom
            All we got was blues

            But through all the sorrow
            We were riding high
            And the truth of the matter is
            I never let you go, let you go

            We were scanning the cities
            Walking to greater dues
            But besides all the glamour
            All we got was bruised

            But through all the sorrow
            We were riding high
            And the truth of the matter is
            I had to let you go, let you go

            You go down just like Holy Mary
            Mary on a, Mary on a cross
            Not just another Bloody Mary
            Mary on a, Mary on a cross

            If you choose to run away with me
            I will tickle you internally
            And I see nothing wrong with that
            We were searching for reasons

            To play by the rules
            But we quickly found
            It was just for fools
            And after all the sorrow

            We'll be riding high
            And the truth of the matter is
            I'll never let you go, let you go
            You go down just like Holy Mary

            Mary on a, Mary on a cross
            Not just another Bloody Mary
            Mary on a, Mary on a
            You go down just like Holy Mary

            Mary on a, Mary on a cross
            Your beauty never ever scared me
            Mary on a, Mary on a cross
            If you choose to run away with me

            I will tickle you internally
            And I see nothing wrong with that
            Nothing wrong with that
            (Mary on a, Mary on a cross)

            Nothing wrong with that
            (Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
            Mary on a, Mary on a cross
